# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project covers basic concepts of Python, focusing on conditional statements (`if/else`), loops, and functions. Below is a brief description of each task included in this project.

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- **File:** `0-positive_or_negative.py`
- **Description:** This script assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit
- **File:** `1-last_digit.py`
- **Description:** This script assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints the last digit of the number, followed by whether the last digit is greater than 5, is 0, or is less than 6 and not 0.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- **File:** `2-print_alphabet.py`
- **Description:** This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without any spaces or newlines. Only one print function and one loop are allowed.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- **File:** `3-print_alphabt.py`
- **Description:** This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters `q` and `e`, without any spaces or newlines. Only one print function and one loop are allowed.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing
- **File:** `4-print_hexa.py`
- **Description:** This script prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format. Only one print function and one loop are allowed.

### 5. 00...99
- **File:** `5-print_comb2.py`
- **Description:** This script prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by `, `, in ascending order, each number being two digits long. Only two print functions and one loop are allowed.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
- **File:** `6-print_comb3.py`
- **Description:** This script prints all possible different combinations of two digits. The two digits must be different and printed in ascending order. Only three print functions and two loops are allowed.

### 7. islower
- **File:** `7-islower.py`
- **Description:** This function checks if a character is lowercase and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The function cannot use any module or `str.upper()` and `str.isupper()` methods.

### 8. To uppercase
- **File:** `8-uppercase.py`
- **Description:** This function prints a string in uppercase followed by a newline. The function cannot use any module or `str.upper()` and `str.isupper()` methods.

### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
- **File:** `9-print_last_digit.py`
- **Description:** This function prints the last digit of a number and returns the value of the last digit.

### 10. a + b
- **File:** `10-add.py`
- **Description:** This function adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. a ^ b
- **File:** `11-pow.py`
- **Description:** This function computes the power of `a` to `b` and returns the result.

### 12. Fizz Buzz
- **File:** `12-fizzbuzz.py`
- **Description:** This function prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by spaces. For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
