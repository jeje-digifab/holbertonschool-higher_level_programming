# Project Tasks Summary

This README provides a summary of the tasks to complete for the project.

## Task 1: Verify the authenticity of all values in DBStorage and FileStorage
- **Objective**: Ensure that all objects created in the database (DBStorage) and file storage (FileStorage) are genuine and adhere to their respective storage systems.
- **Actions**: Conduct tests and validation to confirm the accuracy and completeness of all data stored in both storage systems.

## Task 2: Optimize database access by avoiding costly queries
- **Objective**: Improve the performance of the project by minimizing expensive database queries.
- **Actions**: Implement optimizations such as lazy loading and caching where appropriate, to reduce the number of queries executed during runtime.

## Task 3: Validate attribute data types in DBStorage and FileStorage
- **Objective**: Ensure that all attributes stored in both DBStorage and FileStorage have the correct data types.
- **Actions**: Create unit tests or assertions that confirm each attribute adheres to the expected type, and fix any discrepancies.

## Task 4: Optimize queries in your program
- **Objective**: Further improve performance by fine-tuning the queries executed within the program.
- **Actions**: Identify queries that can be optimized, reduce the amount of redundant data retrieval, and implement more efficient querying methods where necessary.

## Task 5: Validate storage for all objects in the database
- **Objective**: Verify that all objects within the database are stored correctly and consistently.
- **Actions**: Conduct tests that validate the proper functioning of the database storage system and ensure that all objects persist accurately.
